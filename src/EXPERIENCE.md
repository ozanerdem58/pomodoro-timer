# Vibe Coding Experience – Bolt.new

## Tool Selection Justification
I chose Bolt.new because it provides an AI-powered, agentic development experience directly in the browser. It allows generating complete applications from high-level natural language descriptions, which fits the concept of vibe coding.

## Development Process
The project was created by describing the Pomodoro Timer requirements in natural language. Bolt.new generated the full project structure and implementation automatically. I tested the application using the built-in preview environment.

## Challenges and Solutions
Understanding the generated timer logic required some review. While the AI handled most of the implementation, I verified the functionality manually. Bolt.new made it easy to experiment and validate results quickly.

## Reflection
Vibe coding shifted my focus from writing code line by line to expressing intent. This approach was efficient and intuitive. I would use similar tools for prototyping and small projects in the future.
